/**
 * The editor's traffic-signal domain, over v2's stable map handles.
 *
 * ## What v2 changed, and why this is not a transliteration of v1
 *
 * v1 bound signal authoring to `map_assets` rows, OpenDRIVE road ids and a
 * runtime CARLA bundle, and every one of those renumbers across a UE5 map
 * rebuild. Roughly a third of v1's 9,253 lines of signal code exists to survive
 * that instability: a sha256 identity gate between the topology index's source
 * XODR and the uploaded artifact (`xodr-signal-groups.server.ts`), a 25 m
 * geometric "which junction is this light standing in" fallback
 * (`attributeLightsToJunctions`), a `topology_only` signalization tier for maps
 * with no compiled semantic graph, and a per-process cache keyed on a hand-bumped
 * derivation version.
 *
 * v2 deletes the premise. `simforge.map_versions` carries `xodr_artifact_id`,
 * `xodr_sha256`, `topology_artifact_url`, `signals_artifact_id` and
 * `coordinate_system_sha256` **on one row**, under
 * `UNIQUE (workspace_id, xodr_sha256, coordinate_system_sha256)`. A map version
 * *is* its XODR identity, so the XODR a signal binding was authored against and
 * the topology it was attributed through cannot disagree — the check v1 spent a
 * module on is satisfied by the schema. See `MapSignalPlan.binding`, which
 * carries `mapId` + `junctionId` + `controlDigest` for exactly this reason: the
 * digest is a content hash of the compiled control plan, so a stale binding is
 * caught by value rather than by re-deriving ids.
 *
 * ## The three grains, and which one an author touches
 *
 * | grain | id | comes from |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | physical head | OpenDRIVE `<signal>` id, e.g. `900` | `MapSignalCatalog.heads` |
 * | controller stage | OpenDRIVE `<controller>` id, e.g. `951` | `MapSignalCatalog.controllers` |
 * | movement | engine program id, `signal:<firstHeadId>` | `SignalProgram.mapBinding` |
 *
 * An author clicks a **head**. `selectSignalReference` resolves that to exactly
 * one reference movement and one controller stage, plus the head sets to
 * highlight. A `MapSignalPlanClip` then names `{ controllerId, headId }` and one
 * indication, and `evaluateSignalReferencePhase` projects that onto every other
 * head at the junction, failing closed when a program cannot express the result.
 *
 * That is why this module carries **no per-movement state map**. v1's
 * `SignalPhaseInterval.states: Record<movementId, BehaviorSignalState>` restated
 * every movement in the junction on every interval, and v1 needed
 * `allRedStates`/`withGroup` helpers to keep those maps consistent. In v2 a clip
 * states one head's indication and the compiler derives the rest, so the whole
 * class of "the panel invented a partition the validator disagrees with" bug
 * that v1's `synthesizeSignalProgram` comment warns about cannot occur here.
 *
 * ## Baseline timing is the map's, not an editor invention
 *
 * v1's `map_default` mode meant "every dynamic light is forced GREEN and frozen
 * for the whole scenario" — a decision forced on it because v1 had no map-owned
 * program to fall back to. v2 has one: `buildMapControlPlan` emits a real
 * looping `SignalProgram` per controller-stage group, and
 * `compileMapSignalPlans` retains that baseline through warm-up and through
 * every interval no clip covers. So "no plan" is a *better* default than v1's
 * forced green, and {@link SignalPlanMode} has no `map_default` member: the
 * absence of a `MapSignalPlan` is the mode.
 *
 * ## Where these inputs come from
 *
 * Everything here is structural, so the pure model runs in tests with no S3, no
 * database and no React. `control-plan.server.ts` is the one module that reads
 * artifacts; it produces {@link EditorSignalControlProjection}, which is what
 * crosses the wire and what every function in this folder consumes.

 * `MapSignalPlanClipSchema` refines the enum down to these six and

 *
 * This is consistent with the hardware model rather than a limitation of it.
 * A protected-left head shows a green ARROW because its lens is an arrow — that
