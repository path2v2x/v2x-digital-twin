/**
 * What the timeline dock's signal lane draws, and what painting on it produces.
 *
 * ## Two tiers, and the second one is new
 *
 * v1's lane had one tier: the junction's authored colour. It could not have had
 * two, because v1 had no map-owned baseline — its unplanned state was a forced
 * green with no timing at all.
 *
 * v2 does, so the lane shows both:
 *
 * - **authored** bands, from the plan's clips;
 * - **baseline** bands, from the map's own looping `SignalProgram`, wherever no
 *   clip covers — which is precisely what `compileMapSignalPlans` will run
 *   there.
 *
 * That makes the lane an accurate picture of the compiled result rather than of
 * the authored fragment, and it makes an intentional gap ("hand it back to map
 * timing") visually distinct from an unauthored junction.
 *
 * The baseline bands are drawn from `synthetic-default` timing on every
 * production map. `map-signals.ts` is explicit that RoadRunner supplies real
 * head ids, controller membership and stage order but *not* authoritative phase
 * durations. The lane must carry that provenance to the component
 * ({@link SignalTimelineBand.source}) so the UI can render baseline bands as
 * provisional; an author who reads them as surveyed timing will not author the
 * timing they actually need.
 *
 * ## One row per junction, not one per movement
 *
 * Eight rows for an ordinary four-way would bury the actor lanes, so the lane
 * shows the junction's DOMINANT indication — green over yellow over red — which
 * answers the question the lane exists for: is this junction letting anything
 * through, and when does that change. Per-head detail belongs to the
 * intersection panel, which has the room for it.
 *
 * Sampled at each interval's MIDPOINT rather than at its edges, so a zero-width
 * artefact at a boundary cannot produce a phantom band, and neighbouring
 * intervals that agree are merged.
