/**
 * What a trigger picker needs in order to reference a signal, and nothing more.
 *
 * ## The seam, and why it points this way
 *
 * v1 already discovered this boundary. `timeline-model.ts:491` defines
 * `SignalTriggerTarget` as ids and labels only — no plan, no phase program, no
 * movement bindings — and its docblock records the reason: *"the picker needs a
 * junction to be referenceable before anyone authors a plan for it, and the
 * movement table is all it reads."* The same file's `runtimeBlockReason` records
 * that the `signal_state` blocker was deliberately **removed** because "its
 * evaluator shipped with the signal plans". So v1 had already pushed signal
 * evaluation out of the timeline and left only a structural payload at the seam.
 *
 * This is that payload, unchanged in shape and re-derived from v2's projection.
 * It is the only type the behaviour and timeline layers need from this folder,
 * which is what lets the dependency run one way: they consume
 * {@link SignalTriggerTarget}, and nothing outside `lib/scenario/signals/**`
 * imports a stage, a clip, a cycle or a control index.
 *
 * ## Two grains, both offered, because they answer different questions
 *
 * A trigger can reasonably say either:
 *
 * - *"when junction 100 lets the cross street through"* — the junction grain; or
 * - *"when the northbound protected left goes green"* — the **stage** grain.
 *
 * v1 offered the second at the *movement* grain. In v2 a movement is not the
 * thing a clip commands — a controller stage is — so {@link signalTriggerTargets}
 * reports stages under the `movements` key. The key name is kept because it is
 * v1's wire shape and the picker's rendering does not change; what changed is
 * that each entry is now a grain the compiler can actually hold at one
 * indication, so a trigger written against it cannot reference something with no
 * single state.
 */

 * Unplanned junctions are included on purpose — that is v1's rule and it is

 * governs it, so "when this light goes green" is a perfectly well-defined
 * trigger against an unplanned junction; requiring a plan first would make the
 * author author timing they did not want in order to reference timing that was
 * already running.
