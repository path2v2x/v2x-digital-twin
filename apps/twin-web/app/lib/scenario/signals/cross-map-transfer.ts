/**
 * Carrying a signal plan onto another map version.
 *
 * ## What v1 needed, and what v2 makes unnecessary
 *
 * v1's `cross-map-signal-transfer.ts` (507 lines) had to rewrite ids. Its plans
 * keyed on `movement_id` strings it minted from OpenDRIVE road ids, and those
 * renumber across a UE5 rebuild — so a transfer meant re-deriving the target's
 * movement tables (`readSignalMovementTables`, which pulled a topology bundle, a
 * semantic graph publication and a XODR through a sha256 identity gate), then
 * matching source movements to target movements, then rewriting every plan and
 * every actor behaviour that referenced a signal state. If any input could not
 * be read it had to **fail the transfer explicitly**, because a silently
 * unenforceable signal plan is worse than a refused one.
 *
 * v2 keeps the failure discipline and drops the rewriting. Two reasons:
 *
 * 1. **Nothing is rewritten in place.** A `MapSignalPlan` binds to
 *    `{ mapId, junctionId, controlDigest }`. A different map version is a
 *    different `mapId` and a different digest, so the plan does not *become*
 *    invalid — it is already, provably, not about the target map, and
 *    `compileMapSignalPlans` says so with `map_signal_plan_map_mismatch`. There
 *    is no id to renumber because the plan never carried a derived id.
 * 2. **Matching is a projection lookup, not a derivation.** The target's stages,
 *    heads and turn relations arrive in an
 *    {@link EditorSignalControlProjection} built once per map version. v1's
 *    three-artifact read with its identity gate has no analogue to port.
 *
 * So what remains is the genuinely hard part v1 also had: deciding **which
 * junction on the target corresponds to the source's**, and whether the
 * correspondence is close enough that the author's timing still means what they
 * meant. That is a judgement, so this module produces a scored proposal and
 * never applies one.
 *
 * ## Timing transfers; stage identity does not
 *
 * The transferable content of a plan is the author's *timing* — how long green,
 * how long yellow, how long red, and which approach leads. Controller ids are
 * the target map's own and must not be carried across. So a transfer
 * decompiles the source plan to a cycle, reads the three numbers back out of it,
 * and recompiles them against the target junction's stages. A source plan that
 * was hand-painted rather than generated cannot survive that round trip, and
 * {@link proposeSignalPlanTransfer} reports it as `hand_painted` rather than
 * approximating it.
