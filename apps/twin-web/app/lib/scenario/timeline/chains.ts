/**
 * `after` chains: asking about a cycle BEFORE the author commits to one.
 *
 * The model reports a closed chain as `trigger_cycle`, and `resolveTriggerTime` degrades a cyclic
 * chain to the full window rather than recursing — so nothing here is a safety net. This answers the
 * other version of the question: given that the author is about to pick a parent from a list, which
 * entries in that list would close a ring?
 *
 * The difference is the whole point. A validator issue arrives after the mistake, on a document that
 * now has a ring in it, and every interaction in the ring waits for one that waits for it, so none of
 * them ever fires. A disabled option in the picker means the mistake was never available. Both are
 * wanted; only one of them needs the author to read an error list.
 *
 * This is the v2 reshape of v1's `clipIdsThatWouldLoop`, which walked `after_clip` parents. v2's
 * `after` also carries `event: 'start' | 'end'`, but the cycle question ignores it: waiting for either
 * end of an interaction that is waiting for you is the same deadlock.

 * `self_reference`, and reporting it here as well would put the same entry behind two explanations.
