/**
 * How a lane gets onto the timeline without the timeline knowing what it is.
 *
 * This is the seam between this lane and the signals lane. `signal-timeline-model.ts` and
 * `SceneSignalLane` belong to `signals-porter`; the timeline renders a signal lane but must never
 * import from `lib/scenario/signals/**`. Three properties make that hold:
 *
 *  1. `datum` is generic, so a lane carries state the timeline has no type for.
 *  2. `spans(window)` is a PULL, so each lane keeps ownership of its own sampling. The timeline asks
 *     "what is in this window", it does not subscribe to signal internals or reimplement phase
 *     evaluation.
 *  3. Registration is one-directional — signals import this module, never the reverse.
 *
 * v1 had already started down this road: `SignalTriggerTarget` in `timeline-model.ts` is purely
 * structural (`junction_id`, `label`, `movements`), and the `signal_state` blocker was deliberately
 * deleted from `runtimeBlockReason` because "its evaluator shipped with the signal plans". This
 * formalises the direction rather than inventing it.
