/**
 * The v2 timeline domain model: temporal geometry, the clip window, the authoring grid, interaction
 * layout, and the lane-registration seam.
 *
 * Framework-free by rule — no React, no imports from `app/components/**`. The timeline UI imports from
 * here; nothing here imports from the UI.
 *
 * The behaviour taxonomy (triggers, the verb palette, blockers, execution backend) is NOT here. It
 * lives in `lib/scenario/behavior/**`, because the inspector and the action palette need it for
 * reasons that have nothing to do with a timeline, and a path that implies otherwise misleads every
 * future reader.
