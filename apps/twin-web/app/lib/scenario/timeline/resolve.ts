/**
 * Interaction layout: turning the model's static timing analysis into rail geometry.
 *
 * ## This is an adapter, not a resolver
 *
 * v1 computed clip starts itself, in `timeline-model.ts::computeClipStarts` — walking `after_clip`
 * chains, guarding cycles, falling back to t=0. v2 does not need that ported, because
 * `@simforge-oss/scenario` already does the whole analysis in `validate/timing.ts`:
 * `resolveTriggerTime` and `endBound` handle `at` / `after` / `when` / `arrival`, evaluate parameter
 * expressions at their declared defaults, guard `after` cycles, and honour the `event: 'start' | 'end'`
 * distinction that v1 had no equivalent for.
 *
 * Writing a second implementation here would be the worst kind of duplicate: two static analysers that
 * agree today and drift later, whose disagreement surfaces as "the validator says this fires at 3.5 s
 * but the timeline draws it somewhere else" — a bug that looks like a rendering defect and is not one.
 * So this module owns exactly one thing the model deliberately does not: how a `TimeBound` becomes a
 * rectangle.
 *
 * ## How indeterminacy is drawn
 *
 * The model returns three kinds of answer and never guesses. This layer must draw something anyway, so
 * it draws the earliest instant the interaction could fire and flags the chip `armed`. That is a
 * presentation decision, and it is why `armed` is on the returned record rather than baked into the
 * position: the UI must be able to say "somewhere from here" instead of quietly asserting a time the
 * analysis never claimed.
