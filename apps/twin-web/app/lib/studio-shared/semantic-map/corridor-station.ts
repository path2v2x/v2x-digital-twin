/**
 * Turning "this far along this corridor" into an anchor the runtime can resolve.
 *
 * A corridor is a semantic object: it spans however many OpenDRIVE lane
 * segments the map happens to be cut into, and its polyline is stored in TRAVEL
 * order (`lanePolyline` normalises that). An executable anchor is an OpenDRIVE
 * object: one `road:section:lane`, plus a fraction along the road's `+s` axis.
 * Everything that places an actor on a corridor has to cross that gap, and
 * getting it wrong is quiet — a plausible anchor that resolves to the wrong end
 * of the lane still runs, it just drives somewhere else.
 *
 * Two callers cross it: the semantic actor binder (author picks an entity) and
 * the autopilot route compiler (a walk produces a series of stations). They
 * shared nothing before, which is exactly how the route compiler ended up
 * shipping a hardcoded `s_fraction` of 0.5 — every anchor collapsing onto its
 * lane's midpoint — while the binder next door had it right. One implementation,
 * so the next caller inherits the correct convention instead of re-deriving it.
