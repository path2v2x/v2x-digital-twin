/**
 * Derive the route a placed vehicle drives when nobody drew one.
 *
 * ## Why this replaces `autopilot`
 *
 * The authoring model is: place a car on a lane and it drives — straight, along
 * the lane, at a speed — and the timeline steers it. Nothing about "where does
 * it go" is authored or stored for the common case
 * (`plans/2026-07-29-one-motion-model.md`). Something still has to answer the
 * question, and there were only ever two candidates:
 *
 * - **CARLA's Traffic Manager.** Reproducible today, but a function of the CARLA
 *   build, the map revision and the TM's own implementation, with no
 *   OpenSCENARIO equivalent. `compile-autopilot-route.ts`'s header documents why
 *   that is a bad thing to depend on.
 * - **The lane graph, walked deterministically.** Pure, offline, exportable, and
 *   identical in the browser and the worker because both derive it from the same
 *   published graph.
 *
 * This is the second one. It is `compileAutopilotRoute`'s walk with two changes,
 * and it deliberately reuses that walk rather than forking it: junction choice
 * becomes **straightest-first** instead of seeded, and an ordered list of
 * authored turn intents can override the choice at successive junctions.
 *
 * ## Straightest, not seeded
 *
 * A seeded pick is right for ambient traffic — you want a spread of behaviour
 * across a population, and each car stable run to run. It is wrong for an
 * authored actor: "I placed a car here" means "it carries on", not "it takes a
 * hash-determined turn at the next intersection". Straightest-first makes the
 * default legible, which is the property an author needs from a route they did
 * not draw.
 *
 * ## Turn intents
 *
 * `turnAtJunctions` is consumed in order, one per junction the walk reaches. It
 * is how a `turn` interaction clip ("turn left at the next junction") becomes
 * geometry without the author placing a single point. An intent that no movement
 * at that junction can satisfy is reported in `unmetTurns` and the walk falls
 * back to straightest — reporting rather than guessing, because a turn the map
 * cannot make is an authoring error the editor must surface, not a silent
 * straight-on.

 * that the road ended. Two causes, both since fixed, and the history is worth
 * keeping because both were invisible from inside this file:
 *
 * - Junction seams failed on geometry the CARLA crawl had truncated
 *   (`GATE_GEOMETRY_DISCONTINUITY`, fixed by `runtime-lane-geometry.ts`'s
 *   splice). On San Ramon Part 1, 2026-07-29, 684 of 941 variants were
 *   `diagnostic_only` and the median walk covered one ~20 m corridor.
 * - Gates naming a lane shorter than the crawl's sampling step could not bind at
 *   all, because that lane appears in no crawled segment (fixed by link-attested
 *   binding in `build-runtime-parity.ts`).
 *
 * After both, 2026-07-30 over the nine dev maps: 98.1 % of gates a car can
 * arrive on bind, and an early stop is now usually honest. Of the corridors with
 * no authorable way out, CARLA's own successors agree there is nowhere to go for
 * the large majority; only 9 across all nine maps are a connection the runtime
 * has and this graph does not.
 *
 * So `stopReason` is still worth surfacing verbatim in the editor — "route ends
 * here" with no reason sends an author hunting a bug in their scenario — but
 * `no_continuation` should now be read as probably real. Re-measure with
 * `scripts/agent/connectivity-scorecard.mjs` before believing otherwise.

 * 2026-07-29: comparing against the anchors reported "no match" for 58 of 361
 * vehicles whose migration was correct, including egos that fit within a metre.
 *
 * The legs name corridors and movement variants by id and both carry their own
