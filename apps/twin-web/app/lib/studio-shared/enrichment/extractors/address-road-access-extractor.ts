 *
 * Why this exists: an address point sits on the lot or rooftop, not on a
 * drivable surface — a vehicle simulation can't spawn there. The snapped
 * point on a road segment is the closest legal start position, and the
 * distance gives a sanity signal ("if a snap is 200 m away, the address
 * is probably misplaced or sits on a private drive we don't have").
 *
 * Pure function — no I/O. Mutates `addresses[*].row.road_access_*` and
 * returns the same array for ergonomics.
