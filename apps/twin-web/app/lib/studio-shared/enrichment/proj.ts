/**
 * Single chokepoint for every WGS84 ↔ CARLA-local-meter projection in the
 * codebase. Every consumer projecting between geographic and projected
 * coordinates does so through a `MapProjection` instance, which wraps proj4
 * against the PROJ string declared in the XODR's `<geoReference>` (or a
 * vanilla `+proj=tmerc` synthesized from `origin_lat`/`origin_lon` for legacy
 * assets that don't have a full PROJ string on record).
 *
 * Why a class instead of free functions: a `MapProjection` constructs its
 * proj4 converter once and reuses it across calls, instead of re-parsing the
 * PROJ string per call. It also gives us a single seam to swap proj4 for
 * another library later (or stub it in tests) without touching call sites.
 *
 * Why proj4 instead of hand-rolled math: SimForge is a geospatial product and
 * the maps we ingest can in principle declare any PROJ-supported projection.
 * Hand-rolling the math (as we previously did with a Snyder series for TMerc)
 * works for one specific projection family but silently produces wrong
 * results the moment a new map declares anything else — different ellipsoid,
 * false easting/northing, a non-tmerc projection, etc. proj4 parses the full
 * PROJ string spec and handles every projection type the upstream PROJ
 * library supports.
 *
 * The historical bug this layer replaced: earlier code used a flat-earth
 * equirectangular approximation (`x = (lng - lon0) * 111320 * cos(lat0)`,
 * `y = (lat - lat0) * 111320`) that diverged from the XODR-declared TMerc by
 * 0.13–0.27% per metre away from origin. Routing every projection through
 * this class against the asset's actual `<geoReference>` PROJ string makes
 * that class of error structurally impossible.
