/**
 * Derive traffic-signal movement grouping from a raw OpenDRIVE (.xodr) file.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * Our RoadRunner-exported maps carry `<signal>` elements but no
 * `<controller>`/`<control>` elements, and nothing anywhere joins a signal to
 * the junction it controls: `build-topology-index.ts` has no signal handling at
 * all, and the `signals_geojson` overlay carries `road_id`/`s`/`t` but no
 * junction id. So the two halves of "which lights govern this approach" live in
 * two artifacts that never meet.
 *
 * This module performs that join, purely from the xodr, and is the source the
 * `<controller>` enrichment (`enrich-xodr.ts`) and the authoring UI both read.
 *
 * ## Approach identity is NOT invented here
 *
 * Approach ids follow `scenario-signals.ts` exactly —
 * `"<road_id>.<section>.<side>"`, side `l`/`r` from the lane-id sign — and are
 * derived with the same rule `buildMapTopologyIndex` uses for its gates
 * (`build-topology-index.ts`: `rslOf(incoming.id, incSec, ll.from)` with
 * `incSec` chosen by which end of the incoming road meets the junction). The
 * ids produced here are therefore byte-identical to
 * `approachIdFromLaneRsl(gate.approachLaneRsl)`, which is what lets
 * `attachSignalIdsToGates` hand signal ids straight to
 * `deriveJunctionMovements` without a translation table.
 *
 * We re-derive rather than depend on a built `MapTopologyIndex` because the
 * enrichment runs offline against raw xodr bytes, before any topology artifact
 * exists.
 *
 * ## Where signals actually sit
 *
 * Both exporters in the corpus put controlled lights on the *connecting* roads
 * inside the junction rather than on the approach roads (RoadRunner: see the
 * note at `apps/web/app/lib/maps/metadata/xodr.ts` `junction_control_counts`;
 * DeepMap: 49 of 51 controller-referenced signals in the reference corpus). A
 * connecting road maps 1:1 onto `(incomingRoad, laneLink.from)`, i.e. onto an
 * approach — which is why the primary assignment rule needs no geometry at all
 * and no orientation heuristic. Signals sitting directly on approach roads are
 * handled by a secondary rule that does use `orientation`/`t`.
 *
 * A physical head usually governs SEVERAL of those connecting roads, and
 * OpenDRIVE says so with one `<signal>` definition plus a `<signalReference>` on
 * every other road it governs. Both count here; see
 * {@link resolveSignalReferences} for why reading only `<signal>` left most of a
 * lit junction's approaches looking unsignalized.
 *
 * ## Consequence worth knowing
 *
 * One signal head serves a whole approach, so the `left`, `straight` and
 * `right` movements off one approach necessarily carry identical `signal_ids`.
 * Distinguishing a protected-left arrow head would require splitting on signal
 * `subtype` (1000011 subtypes 10/20/30 are the arrow variants); that is
 * deliberately not done here.

/**
 * Fold `<signalReference>` elements into the per-road signal lists.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A physical head hangs over the middle of an intersection and governs several
 * connecting roads at once. OpenDRIVE says that with ONE `<signal>` definition
 * on one road plus a `<signalReference>` on every other road the same head
 * governs — the reference carries the referenced `id` and that road's own
 * `s`/`t`/`orientation`, and no `type`, `subtype`, `dynamic` or `name`.
 *
 * Reading only `<signal>` therefore sees a shared head on exactly one of the
 * roads it serves, and every other approach through it comes out unsignalized.
 * That is the SHARED-HEAD case, and it is not rare: on the Yale St runtime
 * bundle 146 of 185 `<signalReference>` elements point at a traffic light, and
 * 41 of the map's 46 heads are referenced from at least one further road.
 *
 * A reference carries no type, so it cannot be classified on its own — it is
 * resolved against the ids of the `<signal>` definitions this pass already
 * classified as lights. A reference to a stop sign or a crosswalk marking
 * therefore resolves to nothing, which is what keeps `1656`/`1712`-style static
 * signs out of the light tables even though half a junction's connecting roads
 * reference them.
 *
 * Deduped per (road, id): a road that both defines and references the same head
 * (or references it twice) must not double-count it, because
 * `buildMovementTable` compares head SETS to decide whether an approach wires
 * its turns separately.
