/**
 * Collision-scenario archetype catalog.
 *
 * The AI Search panel turns natural-language prompts into populated scenario
 * drafts by:
 *   1. picking a `CollisionFamily` for the user's prompt
 *   2. resolving a map location (`MapSearchDocument`) the family fits on
 *   3. instantiating `actorRecipe` entries against that location's geometry
 *
 * Everything family-specific lives here so the LLM service, the draft
 * builder, and (eventually) the editor share a single source of truth. The
 * shape stays declarative on purpose: an entry is a recipe, not a function,
 * so the same data drives the LLM tool schema, the draft builder, and any
 * future variant generator.
 *
 * v1 covered three families — `unprotected_left_turn`, `unsafe_cut_in`,
 * `pedestrian_crossing`; the CA AV Collision corpus pass added three more.
 * Every one of those plants an actual contact. The near-miss families
 * (`near_miss_cut_in`, `near_miss_pedestrian`) reuse the same geometry
 * recipes but are timed to produce a close pass instead, and are graded
 * against `expectedOutcome: "near_miss"`. Adding more is a content-only
 * change to this file.

  //
  //   1. `nearMissMargin.conflictLeadTimeS` — the planner offset. The
  //      conflicting actor is back-calculated to clear the conflict point this
  //      long before subject reaches it, so the planned paths cross with a gap
  //      instead of on the same instant.
  //   2. `following_distance_m` on the converging clip — the runtime standoff.
  //      `chase_actor` is `ram_actor` with a non-zero standoff (the CARLA
  //      worker literally pins ram's to 0), so swapping ram → chase is what
  //      turns "drive into subject" into "converge on subject and hold a gap".
  //
  // Both are needed: (1) makes the PLAN a miss so the kinematic validator
  // passes it, (2) keeps the CARLA rollout a miss even as the aggressiveness
  // slot scales the NPC's speed — the standoff is a distance, so a faster or
  // slower conflicting actor changes the approach energy, never the gap.

 * generated from the CA AV Collision corpus.
 *
 * These are DOCUMENTED EMPIRICAL DEFAULTS, not a runtime gate: they record
 * what a real crash of each family typically looks like so the recipe
 * constants above are defensible and so the draft builder / LLM can fall
 * back on them when the user's prompt is silent on a primitive. They never
 * override an explicit user choice and are not a safety/risk score.
 *
 * Cross-checks against the recipes above:
 *   - every family's modal participant count is 2 (subject + one conflict
 *     actor) — matches each `actorRecipe` having exactly two roles.
 *   - `rear_end` subject-stopped share = 0.638 (n=235) independently
 *     corroborates the rear_end recipe's "subject rolls up then stops" timeline.
 *   - `dominant_conflict_type` is "vehicle" for every family in the
 *     structured data; `pedestrian_crossing`'s conflict actor is
 *     nonetheless fixed to a walker by the family definition (the structured
 *     mix counts the other VEHICLE in multi-party ped crashes — the prior
