/**
 * "Worker-effective motion" — the behavior an actor_spec actually produces when
 * the CARLA worker drives it, reduced to a comparable canonical form.
 *
 * This is a faithful TS mirror of the worker's driven-polyline construction in
 * `services/carla-worker/carla_worker/route_geometry.py`:
 *   - path      -> `_path_points_for_actor`: [spawn_point, ...path_placement, destination_point]
 *   - timed_path -> `_timed_points_for_actor`: [{spawn, t:0}, ...timed_waypoints]
 * minus the CARLA road projection (`_project_frontend_point_to_road`), which is
 * applied identically to both sides of a round trip and therefore cancels.
 *
 * We use this — not field-by-field equality — as the definition of "OSC is
 * identical to our scenario format": the writer folds the authoring-time split
 * between `path_placement` and `destination_point` into a single trajectory
 * polyline, and the worker re-concatenates them into a single driven polyline,
 * so only the *effective trajectory* is behavior-defining. Comparing effective
 * motion is the honest property; comparing raw fields would flag a difference
 * (which slot a point lands in) that the executor cannot observe.
