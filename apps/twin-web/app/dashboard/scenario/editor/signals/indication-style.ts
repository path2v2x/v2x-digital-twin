 * One module because the panel, the movement diagram and the timeline lane must
 * agree: an author who sees a `flashing_yellow` band on the lane and a
 * "Flashing yellow" row in the phase list has to be able to tell they are the
 * same thing, and v1's three separate colour tables in
 * `signal-plan-model.ts` and the timeline signal lane
 * are why its own surfaces disagreed on grey.
 *
 * Colours come from the `--signal-*` tokens (plan §5.1), not from hex literals.
 * The classes are written out rather than interpolated because Tailwind's
 * scanner reads source text: `bg-signal-${indication}` compiles to nothing.
